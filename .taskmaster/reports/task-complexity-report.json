    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Electron App Infrastructure",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for initializing the Electron app using React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui. Steps should include: 1) Scaffolding the project structure (main, renderer, shared folders), 2) Configuring TypeScript and build tools (Webpack/Vite), 3) Setting up the React environment with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, 4) Implementing the IPC bridge and preload scripts for secure communication, 5) Initializing Zustand stores for state management, and 6) Integrating and configuring Monaco Editor or CodeMirror.",
      "reasoning": "This is the foundational task requiring expertise in multiple distinct technologies (Electron, React, TypeScript). Setting up the IPC bridge securely is technically challenging and critical for app architecture. Configuring the build pipeline for multi-process environments adds significant overhead."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Project Scanner & Discovery",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for the file system scanner: 1) Implementing recursive directory traversal using Node.js fs/promises, 2) Adding logic to detect .git and .claude/ directories, 3) Handling permission errors and inaccessible directories gracefully, 4) Implementing a caching mechanism to optimize performance, and 5) Building search/filter and favorites persistence logic.",
      "reasoning": "File system operations, especially recursive ones, are error-prone and performance-sensitive. Handling OS-level permission issues and ensuring the scanner doesn't block the UI thread (since it runs in the Main process) requires careful implementation. The caching logic adds state management complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Build Sidebar Navigation Component",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the construction of the Sidebar: 1) Building the tree-view UI using shadcn/ui components, 2) Implementing search/filter logic for the project list, and 3) Managing state for favorites and project selection events to trigger tab opening.",
      "reasoning": "This is primarily a frontend UI task relying on existing component libraries. While virtualization is mentioned for large lists, the core logic is standard React state management and rendering. Dependencies on the scanner result make it straightforward to implement once data is available."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create Tab Management System",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Tab Management System: 1) Creating the TabContainer UI component with open/close interactions, 2) Managing global tab state (open tabs, active tab) using Zustand, 3) Implementing persistence to save/restore tab state across restarts, and 4) Adding logic to warn users of unsaved changes before closing tabs.",
      "reasoning": "The complexity lies in state management and persistence. Handling 'unsaved changes' detection adds complexity, as the tab system must communicate with various editor components. However, standard patterns exist for this, keeping the complexity moderate."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Hooks Management Tab",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for the Hooks interface: 1) Building the file I/O layer to read/write .claude/hooks/*.json, 2) Creating the list view with enable/disable toggles, 3) Integrating Monaco/CodeMirror for script editing, and 4) Implementing JSON validation and import/export functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard CRUD operations combined with code editing. Complexity is moderate due to the need for JSON validation and integration of the editor component, but it doesn't involve complex business logic or external system connections."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Rules Management Tab",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline steps for the Rules tab: 1) Implementing file I/O for .claude/rules/*.md, 2) Creating the Markdown editor with live preview, 3) Parsing YAML frontmatter for rule metadata, 4) Adding drag-and-drop or buttons for priority ordering, and 5) Managing enable/disable states.",
      "reasoning": "Higher complexity than Hooks due to Markdown parsing, YAML frontmatter extraction, and the requirement for a split-pane editor/preview view. Drag-and-drop reordering also adds UI interaction complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Skills Management Tab",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the Skills implementation: 1) Reading .claude/skills/*.json files, 2) Building a metadata editor form (name, description, parameters), 3) Integrating the code editor for skill content, 4) Implementing validation against the specific skill schema, and 5) Adding a test execution feature.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to Rules but with JSON instead of Markdown. The 'Test Execution' feature implies the need to interface with a validation engine or mock runner, which adds technical depth. Schema validation for nested JSON objects also contributes to the score."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Agents/MCP Management Tab",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Define subtasks for MCP management: 1) Parsing the claude_desktop_config.json file, 2) Building a JSON editor for server configurations, 3) Implementing an async 'Test Connection' feature via IPC, 4) Polling/monitoring server health status, and 5) Fetching and displaying available tools per server.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex individual tab. It requires handling asynchronous network operations (via Main process), displaying real-time status (health monitoring), and parsing potentially complex dynamic data (available tools). Error handling for network issues increases the difficulty."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Settings Tab",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for the Settings tab: 1) Reading and writing .claude/settings.json, 2) Building form inputs for model preferences and environment variables, and 3) Implementing the theme switcher logic.",
      "reasoning": "A standard configuration form. The requirements are mostly static fields and basic persistence. JSON schema validation is good practice but straightforward here. It is the least complex of the specific feature tabs."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Cross-Project Operations",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the advanced features: 1) Building a multi-select UI for projects, 2) Creating the template system (save/load config sets), 3) Implementing sync logic (copying .claude data between repos), 4) Adding a migration feature, 5) Implementing automatic backups (git or file snapshots) before modifications, 6) Creating an activity log for auditing, and 7) Building a global search index across all projects.",
      "reasoning": "This task aggregates all previous complexities and adds cross-cutting concerns. Bulk operations, data migration, and automatic backups require high reliability. Global search requires indexing disparate file types. The risk of data loss is highest here, demanding rigorous testing and safety checks."
